* What is Immutant?

  [[file:gil.png]]

  - 1.x: Application server built on
    JBoss AS
  - 2.x: Collection of jars that provide
    similar services

* Why the change?

  - a more traditional workflow
    (no install step)
    - application server optional
  - lein plugin only required to deploy to
    app server
  - avoids a plethora of AS issues

* Other changes

  - consistent API
  - less cruft
  - usable as uberjar
  - LGPL -> ASL

* Features

  - web ([[http://undertow.io][Undertow]])
    - websockets
  - messaging ([[http://hornetq.org/][HornetQ]])
  - scheduling ([[http://quartz-scheduler.org/][Quartz]])
  - caching ([[http://infinispan.org/][Infinispan]])
  - XA (in-container soon, maybe out as well)
